        <p>Everyone knows the names Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, few remember the third astronaut of the Apollo 11 mission, Michael Collins. While never setting foot on the moon, he was nevertheless a vital part of Apollo 11. He manned the command module that orbited the moon as Armstrong and Aldrin explored the surface. For a more full day he circled the moon alone and for each of his 30 orbits, spent 48 minutes completely cut off from radio contact.</p>
        <p>Up until that point he had traveled further from earth than any other human. A vital part of space exploration, his experience granted him a unique perspective on life.</p>

          <p>“I really believe that if the political leaders of the world could see their planet from a distance of, let's say 100,000 miles, their outlook would be fundamentally changed. The all-important border would be invisible, that noisy argument suddenly silenced. The tiny globe would continue to turn, serenely ignoring its subdivisions, presenting a unified facade that would cry out for unified understanding, for homogeneous treatment. The earth must become as it appears: blue and white, not capitalist or communist; blue and white, not rich or poor; blue and white, not envious or envied.”</p>
